# Gesture Detection Using Tensorflow.js

This repo contains a sample project showing you how to integrate [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) into a vanilla web project. It leverages the [handpose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/handpose)  package to visualize hand structure and the [fingerpose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fingerpose) package to detect gestures.

We also demonstrate how to add custom gestures that we define independently.

- [the Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/pON_ftmsR40)

## Usage

In order to run the project locally, you need to clone the repo and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn 
```

We can then use e.g. the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) package from VS Code to run the server.
